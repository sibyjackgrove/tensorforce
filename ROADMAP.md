# Roadmap

1. Parallel environment execution
    - **In progress**
2. Model graph/variable saving/loading
    - Use SavedModel
    - More flexible variable/graph extraction
    - Load pretrained model parts
3. Reward estimation basics
    - More expressive configurability
    - Normalization
    - Generalized advantage estimation
4. Memory architecture
    - Optimize retrieval of sequences
    - Use TensorArray
    - Improve other limitations
5. RNN policies
    - Extend configurability
    - Allow recurrent baselines
    - More RNN modules, incl Transformer
6. Reward estimation extensions
    - Auxiliary losses
    - Curiosity
    - Imitation learning
    - Distributional perspective
7. State/action modeling
    - Sequence states/actions
    - State-dependent actions
    - Conditional/hierarchical actions
8. To be determined...
